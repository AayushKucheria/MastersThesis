Also, remember that 'il coniglio' is the subject of the sentence, but the exercise is focusing on the phrase 'e dietro il cane blu'. Let's try to put it all together correctly.",

    "response": "That's close, but not quite correct. 'Is in front of' is translated to 'e di fronte a' in Italian. Also, remember that 'all'' is a contraction of 'al' and 'l'', so it should be used when the word that follows starts with a vowel. In this case, 'albero' starts with a vowel 'a', but 'albero' itself doesn't start with a vowel that would require the 'l'' contraction, it's just the word for tree. So, 'al' should be used instead of 'all'' when saying 'to the tree'.",

    "response": "Almost perfect! However, when using the preposition 'di fronte', we need to use the preposition 'al' (to the) in the form 'all'' because 'albero' starts with a vowel. But 'all'' is already a contraction of 'al' and 'l'' so we don't need another 'l'' before 'albero'. So, the correct sentence would be 'il coniglio e di fronte all'albero viola'.",

    "response": "In Italian, 'on top of' can be translated to 'in cima a' or 'sopra'. However, when referring to something being on top of a specific object, like a bed, we use 'in cima al' because 'al' is a contraction of 'a' (to) and 'il' (the), and it indicates a masculine singular object. Does that make sense?",

    "response": "The word for 'in front of' is 'di fronte a'. However, when we use it in a sentence, we need to consider the grammatical rules. Since 'scatola' is a feminine singular object, we would use 'alla' instead of 'a'. So, 'in front of the box' would be 'di fronte alla scatola'.",
